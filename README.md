# Garbage
This is my realy old project and I was realy bad coder.
And I'm too lazy to update this old project, but making it public anyway.
Maybe this will get updates... some day.

Good luck and have fun.

# Install
1. git clone https://github.com/terokorp/Garbage.git

3. edit it
4. create folders which are defined in config.php
